### Portfolio Site by Lukas Bucher (jfladas)

The site offers some information about myself as well as possibilities of contact, documents and further links. It showcases several projects I've worked on. These are mostly school projects from my time as a Digital Ideation student at HSLU. They range from web design & development to games and ux, with some storytelling, 3d, animation and other creative experiences sprinkled in. Enjoy! :)
